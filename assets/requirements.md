## STRUCTURE
- A public GitHub repository containing your project

- An HTML document for the page

- A CSS document to style the HTML page

- A JavaScript file that retrieves data from one of several public API sources to display the data on your HTML page

- A README file that includes the instructions for running the webpage


## CONTENT
- Display the data for at least 2 of the models in the API<br>
  -Examples: If you choose the use the Weather API, use temperature and condition (rainy/sunny/etc) models. For the Star Wars API, use characters and film title models.

- Include navigation from each modelâ€™s page to the other models that are displayed<br>
  -Example: If you choose to use the Weather API, be able to click between a page that shows temperatures and a page that shows conditions. For the Star Wars API, have a page that shows character information and a page that shows film information.

- Issue new GET requests for the linked data to display in the linked pages.


## FUNCTIONALITY
- Be sure that we can get the code to run without issues by following the instructions in the README file

- Be sure navigation between the different models behaves properly and is not slowed down by requesting more data than needs to be displayed

- Be sure your code is readable and well structured

- If including a user-interactive feature like a search field, be sure that you appropriately handle error cases

- Be thoughtful about what type of styling is used (example: font-sizes are not too small or large, colors are not too dark/light to be easily seen, etc.)
